            ZERO HOUR: Does PM really want Babu-mukt Governance?
          </h4>
          <p style="text-align: justify; font-size: larger">
            Why, the PM has not found anyone more capable than an IAS officer to
            head the committee for the construction of the Ram Temple at
            Ayodhya. The chairman of Food Safety and Standards Authority of
            India is also a Babu, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) is
            headed by a Babu as is the chairman of the Central Electricity
            Regulatory Commission (CERC). Even the Chairman of the Insurance
            Regulatory Development Authority (IRDA) is an IAS officer. Why
            couldn’t the Prime Minister find an expert to head these bodies is
            the question!
